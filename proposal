# Project Proposal: Implementation of New Machine Learning Techniques for Time Series Data in the European Bond Futures Market

---

## Executive Summary

In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial markets, market makers and hedge funds continually seek to optimize trading strategies to improve liquidity provision, risk management, and profitability. This project proposes the implementation of modern machine learning and statistical techniques tailored for time series data in the European Government Bond (EGB) futures market. The ultimate objective is to enhance market-making price skewing and hedging capabilities, while also exploring classification methods to detect profitable conditions, potentially maximizing the Sharpe ratio over time. Since the data will likely be imbalanced—e.g., many trivial signals versus fewer critical trading opportunities—robust performance metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa will be considered. Rebalancing procedures and confidence interval estimations will be employed to ensure that the learned relationships and predictions remain statistically significant and reliable.

A roadmap will outline a phased approach, beginning with classical econometric models (e.g., GARCH, PCA) and progressing toward cutting-edge approaches (e.g., Transformers, foundation models). By integrating cointegration tests, the project ensures that relationships between asset prices remain the focus, eschewing macroeconomic data. We will also implement scaling algorithms to handle increased data volumes efficiently. These steps aim at ultimately improving price quoting strategies, balancing order flow inventory risk, and enhancing hedge performance.

This initiative seeks to deliver a next-generation toolkit for risk-neutral pricing, hedging, and market-making. By leveraging advanced time series analysis methods, we anticipate improved execution quality, reduced market impact, and refined control over the delicate equilibrium between order flow and inventory risk.

## Data Description

**Instruments and Period:**  
The dataset encompasses limit order book (LOB) and transaction-level data for seven European Government Bond (EGB) futures contracts over a 10-day period. Each security is a liquid EGB future traded on a major European derivatives exchange, providing high-frequency data samples that enable the modeling of intraday dynamics and microstructure patterns.

**Order Data:**  
We will extract all order messages (add, modify, delete) with timestamps, instrument symbols, order direction (buy or sell), price, and quantity. This granular dataset allows for modeling how order flow influences price formation and liquidity replenishment strategies.

**Trade Data:**  
All executed trades during the 10-day window will be collected, including timestamps, instrument symbols, aggressive side indicators, and quantities. Integrating this with order data enables the distinction between passive and aggressive liquidity flow, assisting in understanding market impact and inventory risk management.

**Level Updates:**  
Continuously recorded LOB level updates (best bid/ask prices, sizes, order counts) provide insights into intraday volatility, short-term price dynamics, and patterns that can inform quoting and hedging strategies.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to harness advanced machine learning and statistical methods for the European bond futures market. By focusing on price action and order flow rather than macroeconomic indicators, and by iteratively refining models from classical econometric techniques to cutting-edge neural architectures and foundation models, the project aims to deliver more effective market-making price skewing and improved hedging strategies.

A structured timeline will guide this evolution, ensuring that early-stage insights from simpler models inform the deployment of more complex architectures. Continuous validation against robust performance metrics (including Cohen’s Kappa and confidence intervals) will maintain statistical rigor and operational reliability. Ultimately, this integrative approach stands to elevate the practice of liquidity provision and risk management, providing tangible benefits to market participants.
