Presentation Outline: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for High-Frequency Time Series Analysis in the European Bond Futures Market

Slide 1: Introduction
	•	Project Scope: Applying advanced ML and econometric techniques to analyze EGB futures market microstructure.
	•	Goals:
	•	Predict intraday price paths with confidence intervals.
	•	Improve quoting, hedging, and inventory management strategies.
	•	Innovation: Integrating modern ML architectures (e.g., Transformers) with classical econometric models.

Slide 2: Data Description and Preprocessing
	•	Data Overview:
	•	10 days of granular LOB and transaction-level data for seven EGB futures contracts.
	•	High-frequency, intraday price formation and volatility insights.
	•	Key Preprocessing Steps:
	•	Timestamp alignment for handling latency distortions.
	•	Data cleaning (outlier removal) and structural segmentation.
	•	Microstructure Enrichment:
	•	Classification of trades (aggressiveness, liquidity).
	•	Addressing data imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques.

Slide 3: Advanced Feature Extraction
	•	Segmentation Strategies:
	•	Microsecond resolution, event-based intervals, or equilibrium-driven chunks.
	•	Key Techniques:
	•	Path Signatures: Higher-order correlations in order flow.
	•	Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): Structural regime detection.
	•	Dimensionality Reduction: UMAP, PCA, tensor trains for latent factor discovery.
	•	Interpretability:
	•	SHAP values and feature importance for actionable insights.

Slide 4: Modeling Approaches
	•	Classical Econometrics:
	•	GARCH models for volatility.
	•	Markov chains for order arrival distributions.
	•	Modern Toolkits:
	•	Frameworks: TSA, PyTorch Forecasting, Darts.
	•	Tools: TSPP for benchmarking time-series methods.
	•	Advanced Architectures:
	•	Transformers & Mamba: Long-range dependency modeling.
	•	Graph Neural Networks (TimeGPT): Relational insights.
	•	Liquid Nets: Adaptive, real-time learning for dynamic systems.

Slide 5: Hyperparameter Optimization & Model Selection
	•	Optimization Techniques:
	•	Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning.
	•	Evolutionary strategies to ensure adaptability.
	•	Key Focus Areas:
	•	Respecting non-stationarity in financial time series.
	•	Aligning model constraints with market dynamics.

Slide 6: Evaluation Metrics and Validation
	•	Statistical Metrics:
	•	Predictive accuracy (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa, proper scoring rules).
	•	Statistical significance (confidence and prediction intervals).
	•	Economic Performance:
	•	Sharpe ratio, turnover, and market impact evaluation.
	•	Validation Techniques:
	•	Walk-forward validation to prevent look-ahead bias.

Slide 7: Conclusion and Implications
	•	Core Contributions:
	•	Bridging econometric theory with cutting-edge ML for high-frequency trading.
	•	Comprehensive forecasting models including expected paths and confidence levels.
	•	Broader Implications:
	•	Framework extensibility to other asset classes and markets.
	•	Improved efficiency in trading strategies and market research.
	•	Future Directions:
	•	Cross-market generalization and longer horizon prediction.
