Project Proposal: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for High-Frequency Time Series Analysis in the European Bond Futures Market
Executive Summary
This project explores advanced machine learning (ML) and statistical methods to analyze high-frequency data in the European Government Bond (EGB) futures market. By integrating granular order data with level data, it seeks to predict not just point forecasts but full paths with confidence intervals, enabling better quoting, hedging, and inventory management strategies. Combining econometric models with state-of-the-art architectures like Transformers and Mamba, we aim to uncover latent patterns in market microstructure and enhance predictive accuracy, contributing to both academic literature and practical financial strategies for market making and hedging.

Data Description and Preprocessing
Instruments and Period
The dataset encompasses 10 days of limit order book (LOB) and transaction-level data for seven highly liquid EGB futures contracts. The EGB futures market, with its high frequency and granularity, provides a fertile environment for modeling intraday price formation, volatility clustering, and inventory dynamics. While a 10-day window is relatively short, it reflects typical research horizons in HFT contexts and may be extended as needed based on initial results.
Order and Level Data Integration
Integrating granular order and level data is central to this project. Order messages (add, modify, delete) are synchronized with LOB snapshots to analyze short-term volatility, price discovery, and market reactions. Key steps include:

Timestamp Alignment: Synchronizing event arrival times across instruments to handle latency distortions.
Data Cleaning & Robust Statistics:

Employing outlier detection
Implementing filtering rules to remove erroneous points


Ensuring Stationarity & Structural Consistency:

Carefully segmenting data into intervals that reflect stable trading environments
Reducing the confounding effects of structural breaks



Trade Data and Market Microstructure Signals
Integrating trades classified by aggressiveness and liquidity provision status helps distinguish informed from uninformed flow. Such enrichment grounds the analysis in established microstructure theory, aligning predictive modeling with economically meaningful patterns—such as inventory adjustments and the reaction to significant trades.
Addressing Data Imbalance
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) will be considered to mitigate class imbalance by creating synthetic samples of the minority class. This and other strategies (e.g., cost-sensitive learning) help ensure robust model performance across different market regimes.

Advanced Feature Extraction
Time Representation
Time can be defined at:

Microsecond resolution
Event-based intervals
Equilibrium-driven chunks

Each representation has implications for model complexity and interpretability. Event-based segmentation may better capture relevant state changes, while ultra-high-frequency timestamps offer fine detail at the risk of modeling noise.
Advanced Feature Extraction Methods

Path Signatures:

Capture higher-order correlations and non-linear dependencies in streams of order flow
Potentially uncover intricate structural patterns missed by simpler aggregates


Matrix Motifs & Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):

Identify recurring local patterns (motifs)
Align comparable time series segments
Detect structural regimes and shifts in liquidity or order flow


Dimensionality Reduction & Representation Learning:

UMAP and tensor trains
Classical PCA
Reduce complexity of large data
Reveal latent factors driving market dynamics
Unique Opportunity: For researchers with a physics background, tensor trains offer unexplored opportunities to apply techniques from quantum physics to time series analysis
Time2Vec: Encodes time more naturally, allowing models to learn temporal patterns without arbitrary binning


Feature Selection & Interpretability:

SHAP values or permutation importance
Reveal features contributing most to predictive performance
Ensure modeling choices translate into economically interpretable insights
