# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for High-Frequency Time Series Analysis in the European Bond Futures Market

## Executive Summary

This project explores **advanced machine learning (ML) and statistical methods** to analyze high-frequency data in the European Government Bond (EGB) futures market. By integrating granular order data with level data, it seeks to:

- Predict not just point forecasts but full paths with confidence intervals
- Enable better quoting, hedging, and inventory management strategies
- Combine econometric models with state-of-the-art architectures like **Transformers and Mamba**

The goal is to uncover latent patterns in market microstructure and enhance predictive accuracy, contributing to both academic literature and practical financial strategies for market making and hedging.
